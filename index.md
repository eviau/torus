# Poetry on a torus

*En hommage à [Maryam Mirzakhani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Mirzakhani)*

## Abstract

In this essay, we will discuss [the torus poetry project](https://www.github.com/eviau/torus) mathematical background as well as hint as some of the literary references that made this work a reality.

## On the side of mathematics, with examples

Last May, I had the pleasure to rediscover some of the works of Mirzakhani through an online screening of a movie about her and her works, [Secrets of the Surface](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/secrets-surface). 

In this movie, the gist of her work was explained in relatively accessible terms. You might know that she worked on the theory of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces... and you might have heard of the word geodesic. But if I tell you that she was working on counting certain kinds of paths on a torus (something that is donut-shaped) or on a sphere (like the Earth), maybe you are getting curious?

Let's unwrap some of these words in non-mathematical terminology, starting with *Riemann surface*. If you find any mistake, please let me know.

Wikipedia tells us that ["every Riemann surface is a two-dimensional real analytic manifold"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface):

* two-dimensional: think "I can draw this on a sheet of paper"
* real: as in the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number), one of its most famous members is the number pi.
* analytic manifold: for this essay, we will not worry about the manifold being analytic or not, so let's focus on the manifold part. A [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold) is something that locally looks like a three dimensional space - mathematicians usually like to generalize concepts, so here we could more or less than three dimensions.

If you are of great curiosity about these concepts, I would like to send you to [A Tenacious Explorer of Abstract Surfaces](https://www.quantamagazine.org/maryam-mirzakhani-is-first-woman-fields-medalist-20140812), a Quanta Magazine article. Midway through it there is an accessible but more precise definition of these concepts and of the work of Mirzakhani.

What does this kind of structure brings to poetry?

## Merging mathematics and literature

Now, poetry. In this field of artistic and personnal creation, there are lots of mathematics involved. 

We can think of techniques that consist in counting the number of syllables on a line, like [alexandrins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_alexandrine).

There is geometry, as can be found in [calligrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calligram).

There is structure, as we can see on the pages of [Mallarmé](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un_coup_de_d%C3%A9s_jamais_n%27abolira_le_hasard#/media/Fichier:Coup_de_d%C3%A9s_premier_%C3%A9tat.jpg)

You might heard of the [Oulipo](https://oulipo.net/), a group of littéraires interested in constrained writing. By looking at the list of proposed [constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo#Constraints), we will find many that includes mathematical concepts, like the *S+7*: replace every noun by the seventh one following it in the dictionary. Although you might know the Oulipo by having read Italo Calvino, Raymond Queneau or Georges Perec, I would invite you to look at the works of [Michèle Audin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mich%C3%A8le_Audin) if you want contemporary mathematicians interested in literature.

(I would also recommend reading [Analyse complexe](http://irma.math.unistra.fr/~maudin/analysecomp.pdf), but that is for another day!)

Which brings us to to the project at hands: poetry on a torus.

## Poetry on a torus

Inspired by the idea of finding paths on a surface, I wanted to give another dimension to poetry. I wanted to give this idea of mouvement to written words works. I started with a torus (if you ask me, I am really still at the torus). A donut is a torus: it's a ring.

So what if we wrote on a torus, instead of writing on paper ? Now the good part of this is that you can actually write on a torus by writing on a sheet and identifying the upper bound with the lower one, and the left bound with the right one. If you were to glue these identifications, you would have a torus.

We can now fill the sheet with a grid, and write in the squares obtained.

The problem, or the room for creativity, is that we can have different definitions of a point for poetry works. We can say, each square is like a pixel, it is a point on the sheet: I will put only one letter in it. Or we can decide that words are points, or complete lines are points, or...

We can also decide to use a grid made with triangles, or with hexagons (you will find such a sheet on the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/eviau/torus)).

We could also decide to write on a Moebius strip, or on a hexagonal torus. We could try writing on a hyperbolic surface ! Or on a torus of different genus (the donut has a genus of number one, but if the donut is shaped like a 8, it would have a genus of number two).

Where will your imagination take you ?

## Let's write torus poetry together !

Go to the [torus poetry project](https://www.github.com/eviau/torus) and take a look at the `README.md` file. You will find information on the available torus poetry paper sheet available, and instructions on how to create your own.

There is an empty torus poetry sheet available, and you will need [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), a typesetting system for mathematics, to generate new ones.
